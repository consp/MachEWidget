<h2>Introduction</h2>
The widget provides a quick view of many aspects of your F-150.  Once you log in to your FordPass account through the
app and place the widget somewhere on your phone's screen, it will periodically update to show your truck's status.<p>

The widget is shown below. Remember: <b>You need to place the widget on your phone's screen </b>
<ol>
    <li>long press on an unoccupied spot on your screen</li>
    <li>choose "Widgets"</li>
    <li>scroll down until you find this app</li>
    <li>press and drag the widget onto your screen</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the app</h2>
<p>All controls are located in the three-dot menu.
    <ul>
    <li>Select "Ford Log-in" to get started.  Your user name and password are encrypted and stored <i>only</i> if you
        enable "Save log-in credentials" in "Settings";
    the only other information retained from your account are your language and country settings, and the units of measure (distance, pressure, etc).
        Your VIN is stored as it is necessary to access information specific to your vehicle. This
        can be viewed (and edited when profiles are not enabled) in "Settings" from the menu.</li>
    <li>Select "Refresh" to force a query of Ford's servers.</li>
    <li>Select "OTA Update Info" to see information for the most recent over-the-air (OTA) update.  If a change to the OTA status
        is noticed, the "Last OTA" portion of the widget will alert you to check here.</li>
    <li>Select "Change Linked Apps" to choose which apps can be launched from the widget (located to the right of the
        Settings ("gear") icon</li>
    <li>Select "Settings" to change various application settings.  You can among other things:
        <ul>
            <li>change your vehicle's VIN here (without needing to log in again)</li>
            <li>set the frequency at which the widget updates</li>
            <li>enable commands for lock/unlock and remote start when pressing the icons</li>
            <li>enable profiles, so you can sync the app with up to four vehicles</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Icon information</h2>
<p>Red is normally used to indicate something unusual happening when you're not using the truck.  The hood, liftgate, or doors will be highlighted
    in red if they are not closed.  Similarly, if a window is not fully closed, a red icon will appear near the corresponding door --

<H2>Profiles</H2>
<p>If you own more than one F-150, you can use profiles to get status information on each vehicle.  Simply enable "Multiple user profiles" under "Settings", then create a
    profile for each vehicle.  You can then switch between profiles by tapping on the profile name at the top left of the widget.
