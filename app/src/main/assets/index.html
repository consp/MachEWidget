<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img src="/res/drawable/widget_preview.png" width="100%"><hr>
The widget provides a quick view for many aspects of your Mustang Mach-E.  Once you log in to your FordPass account through the
app and place the widget somewhere on your phone's screen, it will periodically update to show your car's status.
<h2>Using the app</h2>
<p>All controls are located in the three-dot menu.
    <ul>
    <li>Select "Ford Log-in" to get started.  As noted on the screen, your user name and password are not stored in the app;
    the only information retained from your account are your language and country settings, and the units of measure (distance, pressure, etc).
        Your VIN is stored as is it necessary to access information specific to your vehicle. This
        can be viewed/changed in "Settings" from the menu.</li>
    <li>Select "Ford Log-out" if you want to stop the widget from updating.  This will remove the stored
        access tokens and turn off automatic widget updates.</li>
    <li>Select "Refresh" to force a query of Ford's servers.</li>
    <li>Select "OTA Update Info" to see information for the most recent over-the-air (OTA) update.  If a change to the OTA status
        is noticed, the "Last OTA" portion of the widget will alert you to check here.</li>
    <li>Select "Settings" to change various application settings.  You can change your vehicle's VIN here (without needing to log in again), and change the
        frequency at which the widget updates.
</li></ul>
</p>
<h2>Icon information</h2>
<p>Green icons are used to indicate the "normal" condition of a component when the car isn't in use  (i.e, it's in your garage or parking space).
    For example, a door's icon is green when it is closed with the window up (closed)
    <img src="/res/drawable/icons8_left_front_window_up_green.png" width="20">.
    The exceptions are
    <ul>
        <li> when the ignition is off -- <img src="/res/drawable/icons8_ignition_red.png" width="20"></li>
        <li> when the alarm is off -- <img src="/res/drawable/icons8_alarm_gray.png" width="20"></li>
        <li> when car is not in deep sleep -- <img src="/res/drawable/icons8_sleep_gray.png" width="20"></li>
    </ul>
<p>The location of each icon represents which door, with the driver's door appearing in the top left.  This corresponds to the bird's eye view. The icons show a small up arrow
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_left_front_window_up_green.png" width="20">
or down arrow
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_left_front_window_down_red.png" width="20">
to indicate the window's position.  Similarly the icon shows the closed position
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_left_front_window_up_green.png" width="20">
or open position
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_left_front_window_up_open_red.png" width="20">.  The trunk and frunk use similar icons.
</p>
The charging status is indicated with icons for the charge plug
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_electrical_green_100.png" width="20">
and the high-voltage battery (HVB)
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_charging_battery_green_100.png" width="20">.
A red charge plug and gray bettery icon indicate the car is unplugged; a green charge plug indicates the car is plugged in.  The battery
icon will then indicate if the car is not charging
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_charging_battery_red_100.png" width="20">, or completed charging
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_charging_battery_green_100.png" width="20">, or is paused
<img src="/res/drawable/icons8_charging_battery_paused_yellow_100.png" width="20">.
