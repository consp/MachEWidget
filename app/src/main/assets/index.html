<h2>Introduction</h2>

app and place the widget somewhere on your phone's screen, it will periodically update to show your car's status.<p>

The widget is shown below. Remember: <b>You need to place the widget on your phone's screen </b>
<ol>
    <li>long press on an unoccupied spot on your screen</li>
    <li>choose "Widgets"</li>
    <li>scroll down until you find this app</li>
    <li>press and drag the widget onto your screen</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the app</h2>
<p>All controls are located in the three-dot menu.
    <ul>
    <li>Select "Ford Log-in" to get started.  As noted on the screen, your user name and password are not stored in the app;
    the only information retained from your account are your language and country settings, and the units of measure (distance, pressure, etc).
        Your VIN is stored as is it necessary to access information specific to your vehicle. This
        can be viewed/changed in "Settings" from the menu.</li>
    <li>Select "Ford Log-out" if you want to stop the widget from updating.  This will remove the stored
        access tokens and turn off automatic widget updates.</li>
    <li>Select "Refresh" to force a query of Ford's servers.</li>
    <li>Select "OTA Update Info" to see information for the most recent over-the-air (OTA) update.  If a change to the OTA status
        is noticed, the "Last OTA" portion of the widget will alert you to check here.</li>
    <li>Select "Change Linked Apps" to select which two apps can be launched from the widget (there are the two places next to the
        Settings ("gear") icon</li>
    <li>Select "Settings" to change various application settings.  You can among other things:
        <ul>
            <li>change your vehicle's VIN here (without needing to log in again)</li>
            <li>set the frequency at which the widget updates</li>
            <li>enable commands for lock/unlock and remote start when pressing the icons</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

</p>
<h2>Icon information</h2>
<p>Red is normally used to indicate something unusual happening when you're not using the car.  The frunk, trunk, or doors will be highlighted
    in red if they are not closed.  Similarly, if a window is not fully closed, a red icon will appear near the corresponding door --

The charging status is indicated by icons for the charge plug
<img src="/assets/plug_green.png" width="15">
and the high-voltage battery (HVB)
<img src="/assets/battery_charging.png" width="15">.
A red charge plug and gray battery icon indicate the car is unplugged; a green charge plug indicates the car is plugged in.  When plugged in, the battery
icon will indicate what is happening:
<ul>
    <li>Not charging -- <img src="/assets/battery_red.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charge paused -- <img src="/assets/battery_yellow.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charging -- <img src="/assets/battery_charging.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charge finished -- <img src="/assets/battery_full.png" width="15"></li>
</ul>
