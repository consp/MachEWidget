<h2>Using the app</h2>
<p>All controls are located in the three-dot menu.
    <ul>
    <li>Select "Ford Log-in" to get started.  Your user name and password are encrypted and stored <i>only</i> if you
        enable "Save log-in credentials" in "Settings";
    the only other information retained from your account are your language and country settings, and the units of measure (distance, pressure, etc).
        Your VIN is stored as it is necessary to access information specific to your vehicle. This
        can be viewed in "Settings" from the menu.</li>
    <li>Select "Refresh" to force a query of Ford's servers.</li>
    <li>Select "OTA Update Info" to see information for the most recent over-the-air (OTA) update.  If a change to the OTA status
        is noticed, the "Last OTA" portion of the widget will alert you to check here.</li>
    <li>Select "Change Linked Apps" to choose which apps can be launched from the widget (located to the right of the
        Settings ("gear") icon</li>
    <li>Select "Save Settings" or "Restore Settings" to back-up or restore your personal data (useful when the app must be removed prior to a new install)</li>
    <li>Select "Settings" to change various application settings.  You can control among other things:
        <ul>
            <li>set the frequency at which the widget updates</li>
            <li>enable commands for lock/unlock and remote start when pressing the icons</li>
            <li>enable the location and OTA alerts (if applicable) on the widget</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Icon Information</h2>
<p>Red is normally used to indicate something unusual happening when you're not using the car.  The hood/frunk, trunk/hatch/tailgate, and doors will be highlighted
    in red to indicate they are not closed.  Similarly, if a window is not fully closed, a red icon will appear near the corresponding door --
    <img src="/res/drawable/icons8_left_front_window_down_red.png" width="20">.</p>

<p>A gray ignition icon indicates the vehicle is off. A red alarm icon with a "Z" indicates the vehicle is in deep sleep.</p>

<H2>Charging Information (for Plug-in Vehicles)</H2>
<p>The charging status is indicated by icons for the charge plug
<img src="/assets/plug_green.png" width="15">
and the high-voltage battery (HVB)
<img src="/assets/battery_charging.png" width="15">.
A red charge plug and gray battery icon indicate the car is unplugged; a green charge plug indicates the car is plugged in.  When plugged in, the battery
icon will indicate what is happening:
<ul>
    <li>Not charging -- <img src="/assets/battery_red.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charge paused -- <img src="/assets/battery_yellow.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charging -- <img src="/assets/battery_charging.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charge finished -- <img src="/assets/battery_full.png" width="15"></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Owners of plug-in hybrids can switch between gas and electric status with a single tap on the progress bar below the vehicle status image.
</p>

<h2>Using Remote Commands</h2>
<p>Remote commands can be enabled under Settings.  When enabled, the ignition icon controls remote start/stop and the lock icon controls lock/unlock.  Double tap on the
    icon to send the command to the vehicle; it may take up to 30 seconds for the vehicle to respond.  A yellow ignition icon indicates remote start is active.
</p>

<h2>Multiple Vehicles</h2>
<p>If you own more than one vehicle compatible with FordPass, each vehicle's status can be accessed from the widget.  Single tap on the vehicle image in the widget's
    upper left corner to see the next vehicle.
